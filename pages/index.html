    <h2>Test Driven Development — July 5th</h2>
  </header> <!--header-->

{% filter markdown %}

So you've heard of this thing called TDD (which apparently isn't dead yet), but you never had a clue how to start? Or you started it, but somehow it didn't click? Or perhaps you'd like to learn a bit from seasoned TDD practitioners? Well, then our workshop is the place for you!

The workshop will consist of 8 hours of hand-to-hand coding mixed with lectures (and a bit of lunch break sprinkled over). We'll be covering basic TDD knowledge: why you should test, how to test, what to test and which tools we consider to be the best solution available right now.
Prerequisites for attendance: 

- *Mac* with latest developer tools installed - *Xcode 5.x with iOS 7.x*. Don't worry if you have any iDacted betas installed.  
- *Knowledge of Objective-C* and generic iOS knowledge - you don't have to be an iOS ninja, but we do require basic knowledge and understanding of how the OS works 
- *AppCode* - we consider AppCode to be an essential tool when it comes to TDDing iOS apps. If you don't have license purchased you can use trial version which is available for download from JetBrains website 
- Humor and *hunger for knowledge*! 

**Cost**

We want to share our knowledge with as many people as possible thus we want to make the workshops as affordable as possible. That's why the price is only 25 € per ticket to cover accommodation and commute costs for speakers. 

However there's one additional cost involved! Don't worry, it's nothing horrible ;) Our speakers are doing this basically for free, for the community. This means they'll spend 8 hours of their time to share their knowledge. That's why it'd be awesome if you could pay the community back with 8 hours of your time, contributed to the community! Don't worry, we have a variety of tasks, so it will be easy to begin. Everyone should find something suitable. But really, most of the active community members are happy they got involved, so that cost may actually be a prize for you.
